Just launched with all modern best practices for building neural networks with TensorFlow and passing the TensorFlow Developer Certificate exam!

Join a live online community of over 600,000+ students and a course taught by a TensorFlow certified expert. This course will take you from absolute beginner with TensorFlow, to creating state-of-the-art deep learning neural networks and becoming part of Google's TensorFlow Certification Network.

TensorFlow experts earn up to $204,000 USD a year, with the average salary hovering around $148,000 USD according to 2022 statistics. By passing this certificate, which is officially recognized by Google, you will be joining the growing Machine Learning industry and becoming a top paid TensorFlow developer! If you pass the exam, you will also be part of Google's TensorFlow Developer Network where recruiters are able to find you.

The goal of this course is to teach you all the skills necessary for you to go and pass this exam and get your TensorFlow Certification from Google so you can display it on your resume, LinkedIn, Github and other social media platforms to truly make you stand out.

Here is a full course breakdown of everything we will teach (yes, it's very comprehensive, but don't be intimidated, as we will teach you everything from scratch!):

This course will be very hands on and project based. You won't just be staring at us teach, but you will actually get to experiment, do exercises, and build machine learning models and projects to mimic real life scenarios. Most importantly, we will show you what the TensorFlow exam will look like for you. By the end of it all, you will develop skillsets needed to develop modern deep learning solutions that big tech companies encounter.
